### CONSTRUCTION & ENGINEERING SERVICES

      ## ABOUT THIS DEPARTMENT

We are a fast growing company when it
comes to construction and engineering;
with over 5 years industry experience of
providing practical engineering solutions
for residential, commercial and industrial
clients across the oil and gas, banking,
real estate, maritime and construction
industry in Nigeria. Our entrance into the
construction business was inspired by a
growing shortage of quality construction
service in the country, especially from
indigenous contractors. We noticed that
the construction challenges clients were
facing with indigenous contractors
encompass poor project management
(which results in project abandonment,
time & cost overrun), unprofessionalism,
undercapitalization, poor communication
skills and budgetary limitation.
In response to these challenges, we have
developed unique core processes to
providing sustainable and value-driven
construction services in Nigeria.
